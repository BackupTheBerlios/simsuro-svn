This code is pre-alpha and NOT yet ready-to-use (as is the
documentation).

Getting started (assuming you've already set up a working
avr-gcc environment under Linux):

1) Select your application in editing target/app-make.in
2) Go to the target/avr directory and type 'make'
3) Download the resulting .hex file to your ASURO

To generate a source code documentation, go to the simsuro
directory and type 'doxygen'. After that, you should have
some html-docs in the doc directory (open doc/html/index.html
in your browser).
